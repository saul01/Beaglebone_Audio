Beaglebone_Audio
================

Audio interface driver for beaglebone board.
The intent of this repo is to create an audio effects (guitar effects) software platform using the
Beaglebone A6 running Linux. I will add more details on the CODEC part number and which interface
of the processor to use on the coming days God willing.
